<br>
Description: Predict how likely individuals are to receive their H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines. Beginning in spring 2009, a pandemic caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, colloquially named swine flu, swept across the world. Researchers estimate that in the first year, it was responsible for between 151,000 to 575,000 deaths globally. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict target values.<br>
